# A program for encrypting and decrypting text messages using symmetric or asymmetric encryption
My course project.

Encryption is performed using two methods to choose from:
* Caesar.
* RSA.

# Technologies used:
Programming language:
* Python.

Libraries and frameworks:
* PySide6 (Qt) – to create a graphical interface.
* Cryptography – to work with RSA encryption/decryption.
* re – to search for keys using regular expressions.

Python system modules:
* os, random, sys – to work with the file system and generate keys.
